# Calculator Made With JavaScript
This was a very challenging project. I spent a lot of my time on MDN docs and other resources. 
I struggled with so many parts of this project, i had to take a day off and come back to it due to frustration. 
I just started familiarizing myself with many different areas of JavaScript like strings, loops, conditionals. I think the hardest part of this whole calculator was organizing the code into the functions, error handling, the event listeners, and basic syntax for the math. so, basically the whole damn thing! Thank god for MDN docs!
